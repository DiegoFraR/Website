  <h1>Who is Diego?</h1>
  <p>I am a student studying Software Engineering at Kennesaw State University from Zacatecas, Mexico that's currently residing in the Metro-Atlanta area.</p>

  <p>With a 4.0 GPA across 2 years at Kennesaw State, I has been invested in pursing his bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. I have been coding in OOP (Object-Oritented Programing) for two years and web development (HTML/CSS) for four years. I love learning new tricks of the trade and solving complex problems.</p>

  <p>I love to help fellow students pursue common interests (Computer Science, Software Engineering, etc.) by helping them in classes that I have taken already through tutoring. I love meeting computer scientists and software engineers and discussing the current landscape of software engineering. While you're here, be sure to shoot me a message, especially if you are looking for interns!</p>
